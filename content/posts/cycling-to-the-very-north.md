August 2023 was a fun and interesting month for me. I traveled to the [North Cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Cape_(Norway)), powered by my legs *(and a bit of train)*.
Starting from Copenhagen on July 30th, I finally arrived on August 21th after 2200km and 18500m+ of positive elevation.
During that time, I took 2 days break (so technically cycled 21 days), and 15 days with, at least some rain.

## How was it?

I landed late on the 29th evening in Copenhagen, it was fairly sunny and warm... but, by the time I recovered my bike, upacked it, and assembled it, a few drop started to come down. Alright then, lets just get started, it'll be fine, I'm sure... it was not. It pourred down rain 5min later, I picked the first hotel along the road, slept there. Me and my stuff already soaked... off to a good start! In all honesty, I was laughting more than feeling bad about it, kind of wishing it was better to have it now than later on.

Next day was looking great! I started without being not perfectly happy with the bags setup I put that morning, but I just wanted to get going, for the first real cycling day.

Slowly but surely I arrived at the first ferry to cross the channel between Helsing√∏r and Helsingborg.
As a fun sidenotes, I wasn't really in the english speaking mindset just yet, so I said "bonjour", out of habits, to the guy selling tickets for the ferry and he replied, surpised, in French and we spoke french afterward. Onboarded in the ferry as the last person was a nice touch.

Sweden, here I am.

I planned to cycled about 100km today, so about 50km left to go after the ferry. Still feeling fairly confident, not tired at all, no growing pain, the bike is handling fine. Lets just keep on going!

Times come by, kilometers pass by, days after days. The landscape reminds me a lot of Brittany in france.

Green, rocky, fairly flat, but some nice hills along the coast.
Oh boy, Sweden, sweet Sweden, you're pretty but so damn rainy. The parallel with Brittany continued with this, but more like Brittany in a rain October month...

I wasn't mentally prepared for that much rain. I knew I was going to have **some** rain, but not that I would get a single day, out of the first 15 days, without rain.

I'm starting to do more double track and single track more than road now!
I love it so much more and I'm *alone*. Sometime you just see a person after 10km, getting mushrooms but that's it.

About ten days have gone past, I was thinking, maybe it's time for a day break, see if it helps boost the morale after the rain, and maybe get back some energy in the legs.
The issue is I'm a scared to be a bit late, so I'm going to take a train during that day.
Remember the rain? Yea, so, about that again... it rained so much that a train before mine derailed due to a landslide when the train got on it.
All train cancelled for the day, and basically, from the info at the time, for the rest of the week as well.
I thus spent a few hours waiting for more information and calling the support as they don't have anybody in the station to help you out.
Got rebooked for the next day, and had to switch from "just a train" to "a train then a bus". Some stress related to "uh, will my bike fit in the bus with all the passengers?"
And because I was arriving later than planned I wanted to get some more km down, so I started cycling again... Surprise surprise, it started pouring with heavy wind again.
Getting back on it after that day break was the worst.

All in all, I don't want to complain, but I'm don't think it was worth it. Just keeping the rythms, maybe pushing a bit more would have been fine. *(And I could say I've done it without the train)*

Mentally it's not all green, I'm missing something but it's not clear what, so I started looking.
After some thought, I pinned the issue to lack of creative process (or even maybe problem solving? these are fairly similar concept I think?).
Some people write diaries or stories, some people draw things, I didn't do much of this at all. I felt a bit bored even sometimes, but that was manageable.
So I started to think about creative things when cycling. It helped, but I just wanted a keyboard to code stuff now...

## Sun, sunny day

As I was getting closer to the north, the weather was going to get nicer and nicer.
With the remaining km count starting to get lower and lower, I felt so much more motivated, willing to push for longer days.
Started with a 130km of very nice road, without any wind and even slight tailwind sometimes. I was done in 6h40 (of riding), this was, for me, insanely good.

The temperature started to get a bit colder, but nothing really annoying, yet.

Time to cross the finland border and the artic circle, not too far away to the finish now.
Reindeers! Reindeers everywhere. They're cute but they seem scared of cyclist (but not about cars, motorbike, trucks and all other vehicule, even when they are super loud...).
And I don't want to find out what they do when scared... they can easily outpace me and definitely outweight me, if they want to.
*(they also don't seem to be the smartest: they get "stuck" nears road fences and then panic if you approach them...)*
I met another french speaking guy, managing the camping and it was nice to see them happy so far away from their origin country.
I didn't spent that much time in finland, but the weather was finally starting to look good. Saunas are more common that toilets it seems.

Now the temperature got a bit colder again and I started to worry a bit about the lack of heavy clothes for night time.
The days are long, and it's really nice thing to have when you cycle long distances.
I missed the midnight sun by a few weeks, but it's alright, I knew that before starting.

## Closing in

Second and last day break, in Alta, before the long and scarsely populated north.
I arrived during the Alta Live music festival so it was pretty crowded!
The food sources, camping/hotel/shelter will be get more distant from each other now.
So I had to pack more food on the bike. I used to pack to have always one meal in advance (so, I can always eat one meal and then have a backup if I don't find anything), but now having something more would be nice. That went mostly fine, until for some reason I miss-managed my food the last day. I only had a small breakfast and needed to do like 40km before the next supermarket. I had some snacks but that was a bit short. I ate all the rest of my food 2km before the supermarket because I was just too hungry.
I bought some extra food, some that I knew I couldn't pack on the bike but just ate it before going on again.
It's the final day anyway!
I learned that the Nordkapp had some kind of nice breakfast available but I packed some anyway.

The tunnels. The multiple tunnels going to the north cap have a small reputation. And they are true, the Nordkapptunnelen is a shared road for almost 7km, with slope as steep a 9%, with a quite high humidity (there's a fog warning sign before the tunnel).
It's a V shaped tunnel, where you go down for about half the length, and then go up for the other half.
I was surprisingly happy to do it though!
You - seem to - go *fast* in the first half. My speedometer is GPS based and my visual cues are completly out because everything is close and fairly dark, so I'm not exactly sure how fast but it's downhill for 3km+, in basically a straigh line.
I never realized how loud a tunnel is when car or noisy vehicule passes you, but after somewhere around 40min under, you definitely notice.

The other 2 tunnels are fine, one of them is even equiped with a dedicated bike lane separated by a concrete wall.

## The end

It's quite amazing what the human body can do, even for a mostly untrained person.
I'm for sure not in bad health, but I'm fairly untrained for such endavours.
Constitency is the key for "long distance" that's for sure.


## So, what's next?

I wanted to never touch my bike again... but after literally 2 days off.... I wanted to come back.
I even cycled the following weekend to come to a close and see what's the limit for me in one day. Sadly I only managed to do 200km with two flat tire, which took me way to long to fix. I sadly lost most of the GPS trace (I discarded it by pressing a button on my watch while refilling some water...).
Is the addiction real? I guess we'll find out next year!


## Random though

- Lots of non swedish/norwegians/finnish people in the touristic industry (hotels, restaurants, bars and such). Some told me that the work conditions are better than in France for example (which is not really surprising concidering the state of french labour in these kind of jobs), and that the experience is worth living!
- I was suprised that some folks don't seem to speak english very well. I imagined the scandinavian countries to be almost fully english speaking (like I've experienced in the Netherlands in longboard)
- Bought some earphones, never used them. I was missing *something* at times, but it was never a urge for music.
- Garmin, why in the world would you discard traces without a way to recover them for like a couple hours or day or until the device is close to being full or *anything*.


I'm not heavily trained, and it was easier than expected physically. The difficult part was more the head. Boredom and lack of creative process was a pain.

The human body is more capable than most people think. I never had done more than 70km in a day cycling. My first day was 95km and it was fine.
I pushed to 130km for the first time, only took me 6H40, with perfect mood and weather condition. Then I pushed to 158km and that was fine too!

THE TUNNEL(s)

Awesome people, doing crazy long cycle

Doing a few km in tromso was awesome, the hills and the house reminded me a bit of San Fransisco for some reason. 

I went home after a few days in Paris and wanted to see the limit, so did a 200km run from my place, and which was supposed to be around the Leman's lake (initially planned 250km)
