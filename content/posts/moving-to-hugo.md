I just had enough of the dependabot notifications for such a simple website.

It used to be an Angular based website and built with Grunt, it's no longer the case.
What a relief.

I've a few post I want to write on security, dev and creative stuff.
I'll try to find the motivation one day for that to happen. No promise.
