> This is an essay that I wrote for fun. I'm no human behavior specialist, nor a network guru. I just started to write a bit and actually think about some experiences I've seen in the past.
> Maybe all these hours playing will actually become a concrete learning experiences after all.

## First, some context
I've been fairly active on minecraft in the last decade, playing and looking at some technical content about farms, automation, glitches and exploits, mods and optimization.
If we embrace the 10000 hours rules, i'm no expert, but I'm not that far either.
I've played and administered small (1-5 concurrent players) servers, medium servers (20-30 concurrent players) and played (briefly) on a few large servers (100+ concurrent).

Each of these have widely different human behavior in places.

### Server player count matters

In small server, everybody is usually already friend and usually play relatively close to each other, both spatially and temporally. You build a village, a few farms and automation along side it, try to match the building style of each other or at least try to fit them.
Once the building (houses, hall, farms, castle, you name it) are starting to stall in their progress, people will start to loose interest, slowly but surely.
Since everybody is friend, and the amount of machinery and building is small, there's few reason to leave far from each other, and thus the transport systems is usually centered around getting into farms that must be in specific places (dungeons and other structures or biomes).


Long time player and watcher.
- small server
- medium server
- long lasting, short lasting
- vanilla, lightly modded, heavily modded


Elytras: released in 2016.

Cars:
Useful but have downsides that are becoming more and more apparent.
Elytras are similar.

## Mods

The minecraft modding community is one of the largest modding community in the video game industry, with tens of thousands of mods, with some recording hundreds of millions of downloads.
With such a wild variety of changes, you can expect notable differences in its impact on the humans factor.

Space and physical constraints in cities:
- IRL:
  - people want dedicated space to live
  - pollution (gaz emission, noise) made by industries make commute time

- MC:
  - Lag when loaded
  - location for farms (structure based, biome based,...)

Community building:
- Isolate people
  - The random bumps between each other is more difficult


Solutions:

If you are familiar with computer networking, the solution might feel like history.
Prioritize different needs: in games, we want congestions while minimizing lags

Mesh:
- most efficient, but
